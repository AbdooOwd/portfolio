# Gaza? What's that?
You really should be a cave-man for not knowing what's all that, you do check your social media tho, right?
But yeah, Gaza. You know? That little piece of land in which 1M+ people live, you can't even call that
"living", it's torture. And this situation is ignored by the whole world, including the United Nations.

# The beginning
About 75 years ago, or more, the British we're like: "Damn those Jews are a pain in the bull, let's give
them a place to live". So, with the fact that Palestine was their's, they threw the Jews there.
The Palestinians we're: "ok.", but after a few time, the Jews started taking lands, the Palestinians 
started getting angry. The Jews continued taking lands which they call now "Israel" until the Arabs got
angry, like really angry, so a war started. Then the UN took the case and split Palestine in half:
a half for the Jews, the other for the Palestinians. But "Israel" continued to expand, and the UN
didn't care about anything. Because of all that, a war started again, and this time, it was and it is
really long, more than 75 years of fighting. 

# What is happening?
What's happening right now is nothing human.
The Jews say that they wanna get back their "Holy Land", pretending: "like it was in old bibles/books".
But if you check old bibles, you'd see that it's called Palestine, and not "Israel".

Do you realize how stupid this is? The UN prohibited the use of white "phosphore", but guess what:
"Israel" used it, and the UN didn't say anything. They consider the Jews' attacks "an act of defense",
while Palestinians' REAL act of defense is considered "terrorism". 
The International Justice Court gave orders to "Israel" to stop all of this. If you were in court, and they
tell you what you'll be (jail or idk), you'd HAVE to do it, right? Well "Israel" just said: ***"no."***...
And the IJC didn't give a *bruh* about it.

You have America literally finance the war (the weapons, bombs, healthcare... etc), but still say:
*"We GoTtA sToP tHe WaR"*, even tho they used their 
**Veto** (i.e a mega vote. Like if they vote, eveybody's vote doesn't count or smthn like that) to 
NOT! And I said **NOT** vote for a ceasefire... Two times! Like recently, they used their Veto against
Algeira's (my country) request for ceasefire.

# Our and Palestinians' future (my opinion)
We should show the world what it is already seeing: **A Genocide**. There is no other name.
Helping the Palestinians might be one of the most important things to do in the 21th century.
And people should understand that "Israel" is being worse than what **Hitler** did.
