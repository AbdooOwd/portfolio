# What's that?
Well, in this article, you'll follow me into coding this portfolio. I'll probably say a lot
of things unrelated on the way there cuz I'll be only talking and explaining, but I love, love,
LOVE devlogs *(btw, devlogs are like vlogs, but for coding)*.
Consider this like, uhhh, a git repository with commits?
