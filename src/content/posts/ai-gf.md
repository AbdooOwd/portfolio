# What the fart?
Yes, an AI girlfriend. Cuz I'm single *(of course)*, and I think that marriage is the way to go. So for now, I made this.
It should be good, it HAS to be good. I spent a lot and a LOT of time to make this...

# How did you make it?

I had no idea of how to do it, so after a lot of researches (and by a lot I mean a **LOT**), I planned my project 
in 3 steps that actually took me 3 days.

## Step 1: Choose AI API
I'm no data scientist, so I don't know what is machine learning or neural network. All I know, is that I need to use 
a model that supports uncensored prompts. So I used the **`lucataco/dolphin-2.2.1-mistral-7b`** 
from [Replicate](https://replicate.com/).

## Step 2: Choose Framework
There is Astro, React, Angluar and Vue for Frontend. There is Node.js, Next.js for backend... After about 35 hours 
of brain burning, I chose Next.js cuz it accessed the model's API without random errors popping in the console.

## Step 3: Make the thing
So I wanted to do something that looked like ChatGPT, so I took a grey background. I suck at CSS so I asked 
ChatGPT for some help. And it was easily done! This is one the best projects I ever made, and yet one of the easiest!

# What did you learn?
How to use AI, and how to do awesome stuff. I also learned a LOT about web development.

# UPDATE: Gemini API [22/3/2024]
I was using that **Replicate API** because I thought that it was limitless. Turned out they just gave me a free time 
that I had exceeded yesterday. So I migrated to **Google's Gemini API**.
