# First time
Hi guys! I'm **AbdooOwd**, an Algerian guy who just loves tech, like coding and robots.
I made this blog using **Astro** and the **Fuwari** template (really cool btw!) in, uhhh, 
VS Code and uhhhh a computer I guess.

Ok let's stop joking. I'm **AbdooOwd**, an Algerian guy who is interested in anything as long
as it is related to tech. I like coding, but I'm also fond of hardware like robotics and wacky 
inventions. 
I made this blog using the [**Fuwari**](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari) template by **Saicaca**,
which uses **Astro** for almost everything.

This portfolio won't only help me enhance my web development skills *(coding skills in general)*, 
but it will let me show the world what I can do, make, design, or any other word that's related 
to this (;.

## How'd you get interested in tech?
Like any other guy, I loved video games and so I wanted to be able to manipulate those worlds.
I also loved math and had my uncle *(a Java dev)* teach me HTML.
So I started using my father's PC to learn programming *(FUN FACT: I used to only code in HTML)*.
And then I realized that HTML sucks, so I learnt CSS, but JavaScript looked stupid to me *(at this time)*.
So I started learning beyond, like Python, Python, Python. Then I started learning other stuff
like Rust, C, C++, Java, GDScript *(for Godot Game Engine)*.

## Random facts about me
* Favorite movie: The Martian - 2015
* Favorite game: Minecraft + Terraria *(with buddies preffered)*
* Most practiced programming language: Python
* Biggest things I've worked on:
    * A programming language called **A--** that I made in 3 hours in Python, then recoded it in 
    C++ to learn the language (here it is -> [A--](https://github.com/AbdooOwd/AMM_lang_CPP)).

    * I contributed to [The Legend of Zelda: The Majora's Mask Decompilation](https://github.com/zeldaret/mm)
    by [ZeldaRET](https://zelda64.dev/) *(I decomp'd the `tokei_tobira` actor)*.

    * A stupid Python chat-bot that uses a self-made database to recognize what (and not HOW) 
    he should answer (it's here -> [chatbot-second](https://github.com/AbdooOwd/chatbot-second)).

    * A portfolio *(not this one)* I made in Astro from scratch without any template 
    *(Well I stole some CSS)*.


So, uhhh, yeah.
