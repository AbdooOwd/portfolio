# Israel Boycott
The pain that Palestine is enduring is not comparable to any right
now. This [war](https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/israel-war-on-gaza/)
is called an act of defense by some, and a genocide for others...

So this is why there's a boycott list; a list of companies that support
this genocide by providing all kind of helps to Israel, but not to Gaza
or the West Bank.
