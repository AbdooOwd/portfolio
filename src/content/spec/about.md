# About
I'm **AbdooOwd**, a 15 years old Algerian guy who loves tech and science in general, 
like coding, robots, math, physics. But I also love video games! 
Like Minecraft, Terraria, Zelda, and Mario (I'm a big fan of Nintendo).

I made this portfolio using the [**Fuwari**](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari) 
theme by [**Saicaca**](https://github.com/saicaca/) with some web development stuff 
like TypeScript, Astro, and a tinsy bit of Svelte for the search feature. 
But I'm planning to make a lot more, I consider this portfolio
a place for me to share anything, but also a project to level up my skills. So I won't be only posting,
I'll also be writing about my journey in playing with this site, and also making stuff like
the [Boycott List](/other/boycott).
